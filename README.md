**Project Title**: Neural Networks for the Publishing Industry: Enhancing Customer Experience and Sales

**Problem Statement:**

Develop a Deep Learning model to analyze and predict customer churn, providing insights that help improve retention strategies and optimize customer engagement, ultimately enhancing both customer experience and business performance in the publishing industry.

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this project is to leverage Deep learning techniques, specifically Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), to predict customer churn in the publishing industry. By analyzing and preprocessing customer behavior data, engineering relevant features, and developing predictive models, the project aims to enhance customer retention strategies and optimize business decisions. Additionally, the project focuses on deploying the trained models on AWS for scalable, real-time churn predictions, ultimately improving customer engagement and sales performance.

**My workflow and Approach :**

Data Collection & Preprocessing
Import SQL data into MySQL and push it to VS code, normalize the tables, and address any missing values. Transform the raw data into a format suitable for machine learning applications.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Generate summary statistics and identify key trends. Visualize relationships between customer segments to uncover insights.

Feature Engineering
Convert and encode categorical variables. Aggregate customer behavior data, such as average time between the orders,Last order date, order count, cancelled order features to support forecasting models.

Model Development
Develop Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models for:
Churn Prediction: Predict the likelihood of customer churn.

Model Evaluation
Assess the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall for churn prediction.

Deployment
Deploy the trained models to AWS EC2 instances for production use and scalable deployment.
